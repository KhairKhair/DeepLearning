Using the MNSIT dataset, both CNN and FCC are implemented. The details of the either type of network can be changed by changing the numbers in the FCN.py and CNN.py. Kernell size for CNN can be changed globally in CNNLayers.py
FCN.py can be run to start training a Fully-Connected neural network on MNIST data, and CNN.py can be run Conv neural network on MNIST dataset.
